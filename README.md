The ALU is responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations on binary numbers. This project involved designing an ALU capable of executing five essential operations: Addition, Subtraction, Bitwise AND, Bitwise OR, and Bitwise NOT. These operations are determined using a 3-bit select input signal (c). Based on the value of c, the ALU chooses the appropriate operation and produces a 4-bit result. Additionally, the ALU includes two status flags:

Carry-out: Set to 1 if an arithmetic operation generates a carry beyond the 4th bit.

Zero: Set to 1 if the result of the operation is zero.

The design was implemented in Verilog and simulated using EDA Playground, an online simulation platform. The simulator used was Icarus Verilog, and waveform analysis was performed using EPWave, which allowed for time-based visualization of all signals and their transitions during simulation.

The ALU was successfully designed and simulated. All operations performed as expected, and the output waveforms confirmed the correct functioning of the ALU logic. This project served as a foundational exercise in digital system design and contributed to my overall learning experience during the internship at Codetech Technologies.
